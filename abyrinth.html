        <p>ABYRINTH is a third-person action platformer set aboard an asteroid mining station. You play as Mylo, a young alien who has come to the station in search of clues to his late uncle's secret life and mysterious demise.</p> 
        <p>In these adventures, Mylo will encounter a colourful cast of characters and find useful items to aid in his journey.</p>
        <p>What lies at the heart of Abyrinth Station?</p>
            
        <h2>About the project</h2>    
        <p>ABYRINTH is an ongoing project. I am working on it alongside Michael Dillabough. </p>
        <p>I have programmed all the mechanics of the game, as well as the menu  and settings. As well, I have made most character models and all visual effects.</p>
        
        <h2>The Mechanics Demo</h2>
        <p><a class="navbox" href="https://skypyre.itch.io/abyrinth">Mechanics Demo</a></p> 
        <p>This is a link to a pre-alpha demo showcasing the mechanics of the game. It does not represent the most current state but it is a good representation.</p>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>These are images of characters and visual development for the look of the game.</p>
